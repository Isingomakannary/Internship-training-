~~~~
~~~~
* Rollover (Same cabling standard on both ends, but reversed order on one end)
Used for device configuration
~~~~

**c. Cabling Requirements & Tools** 
* Twisted pair cable
* RJ45 connectors
* RJ45 Crimping Tool
* Wire Stripper
* Cable Tester  

**d. Cabling Procedure**
* Gather Materials
* Measure the Cable (1.5 inches)

### 2.2 IP Classes
Theses are IPv4 Classes

| CLASS         | RANGE                             | DEFAULT SUBNET MASK      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A             | 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255         | 255.0.0.0                |
| B             | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255       | 255.255.0.0              |
| C             | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255       | 255.255.255.0            |
| D             | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255       | N/A                      |
| E             | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255       | N/A                      |

Please note that Class D addresses are reserved for multicast purposes, and Class E addresses are reserved for experimental use and are not typically used for regular networking.

### 2.3 IP types
~~~~
1. Private Address - Reserved for internal use within private networks, such as 
home networks, corporate intranets, or local area networks (LANs).

2. Public - globally unique addresses assigned to devices connected to the 
public internet.
~~~~
**Private Addresses Ranges**

| CLASS         | RANGE                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| A             | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255         |
| B             | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255       |
| C             | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255     |

# Simulation & Emulation 
~~~~
Network emulators and simulators are tools used in the field of networking to replicate or 
simulate real-world network conditions and behaviors.
These tools are valuable for testing, performance evaluation, analyzing network changes, and 
conducting research or training activities in a controlled environment without the need for 
physical hardware or real network environments.
~~~~
### 3.1 Emulators
~~~~
Network emulators create virtual environments that mimic the behavior of real networks, allowing
users to manipulate parameters and test network applications under different scenarios.  
~~~~
### 3.2 Simulators
~~~~
Network simulators, on the other hand, simulate the behavior of network devices and protocols at 
a higher level of abstraction, aiding in research, protocol development, and educational purposes.
